To use
1. Tap the "Update app" button. This simulates an over-the-air update by creating a new directory under "Libary/NoCloud/ionic_built_snapshots/updated".
2. Tap the "Persist server URL" button to persist the server URL so Capacitor loads the app directly from this directory.
3. Tap the "Delete updated app" to simulate an iOS device migration. This deletes the Library/NoCloud directory which is not transferred from one device to another.
